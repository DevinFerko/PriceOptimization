    "### Price Optimization Machine Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objective\n",
    "We want to leverage a machine learning model to help us set optimal prices, the aim would be to increase revenue and/or margin while keeping in mind market conditions and customer trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Now?\n",
    "I believe we are now well-positioned to design a price optimization model. We have complete access to all our current and historical Brightpearl data, including the pricing information we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Expected Benefits\n",
    "- Revenue Uplift: with optimized pricing we can expect improved revenue performance per product\n",
    "- Margin Protection: An optimized model could help us avoid underpricing\n",
    "- Insights: Clear understanding of demand elasticity by product & segment\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scope\n",
    "TBC\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical prices & sales (SKU × date/time × channel)\n",
    "- Product costs\n",
    "- Inventory & stockouts\n",
    "- Promotions & discounts\n",
    "- Competitor prices ????? Is this achieveable for us\n",
    "- External demand drivers (seasonality, events)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tools: Data warehouse (Perceptium), Python ML stack, Tableau BI dashboard."
